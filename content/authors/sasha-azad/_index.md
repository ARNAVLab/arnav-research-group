I am a Ph.D. Candidate under the advisement of Dr. Chris Martens and Dr. Arnav Jhala in the Computer Science department at NC State University. I model and study large populations of humans by simulating small-scale social interactions that take into account real-world geographic constraints, logistics, lifestyles, and social influence dynamics. With my research I aim to support a variety of applications, such as examining the implications of social science theories and developing playable, explorable story worlds. I believe my research would afford increased entertainment, immersion and replayability for users. 

Most recently, I was a PhD Summer Research Intern at IBM Research. I designed and developed a simuluation that modelled the spread of COVID-19 amongst employees in a workplace using artificial intelligence and agent-based simulation techniques with the goal to mitigate the viral spread amongst employees. 
Previously, I worked as a Research Lab Associate at Disney Research Pittsburgh in the Narrative Intelligence Lab. Before that, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology under the advisement of Dr. Mark Riedl in the Entertainment Intelligence Lab.
